# Minimum Scan Cover and Variants - Experiments

This repository contains the code, data, and evaluation of the paper "Minimum Scan Cover and Variants - Theory and Experiments", [SEA 2021](https://sea2021.i3s.unice.fr/).

The algorithms have been implemented by Alexander Hill as part of his Master's Thesis under the supervision of Dominik Krupke and Linda Kleist.
The final evaluation and visualization have been performed by Dominik Krupke.

* The implementation of the algorithms and the experiment framework can be found in [./code](./code).
* The jupyter-Notebooks containing analysis and visualization can be found in [./notebooks](./notebooks).
